        <h1>Hello MarkForth</h1>
        <p>
            This document was written in MarkForth.
            With MarkForth you write a minimal input file using familiar HTML tags to define the semantic structure of the document only.
            MarkForth will convert the input into a single HTML file that leverages the full power of HTML, CSS and JS.
        </p>
        <p>
            It's like HTML and Markdown had a baby!

            <h1>Automatic Headers</h1>
            <p>
                Organise your content into <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> elements.
                Define all your headers in <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> tags.
                MarkForth will automatically determine which header style to use based on nesting.
                You will never need to go through your document changing <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> to <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code> because you grouped some of your sections together.

            <h1>Component System</h1>
            <p>

                <h1>Table of Contents</h1>
                <p>
                    This component numbers all the section and subsections and generate a table of contents
                    as seen at the top of this document.

                <h1>Code Blocks</h1>
                <p>
                    This component displays blocks of code.
                    There is a button to copy the code to the clipboard in the top-right corner.
                </p>
                <code-block>
                    <span slot="code">
                        "Hello MarkForth" | Write-Host
                    </span>

            <h1>Image Embedding</h1>
            <p>
                When HTML documents reference external images on the local filing system,
                those images need to be transported with the document to be available when viewed from elsewhere.
                MarkForth automatically embeds images in the output HTML for ultimate portability.
